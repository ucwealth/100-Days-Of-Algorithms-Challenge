/*
 This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

 Examples:

 accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
 accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
 accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
 The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.
 */

//MARK:-

func accum(_ s: String) -> String {
  
  return ""
}

let number = 0.1
// Use ceil to remove the fractional part and round up.
let result = ceil(number)


let number1 = 1.1
// Use floor to remove the fractional part and round down.
let floor1 = floor(number1)
